# Wed

*wed* is a simple text editor.

## Name

*wed* stands for **W**ee **ED**itor. I could have used wedit or weditor, but as a Vim user myself I appreciate having to use only 3 keystrokes to open my editor.

**wed** is being written in C with support for VT100 terminals, but this is going to be replaced soon with ncurses.

To compile just run `make`.

## Shortcuts

CTRL+q: Quit the app.
